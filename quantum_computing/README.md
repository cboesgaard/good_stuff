# Quantum Computing

After watching som episodes of Devs I tried to find some good materials to learn about quantum computing.

* The best explantation I have come across is Scott Aaronson's: [Scott Aaronson: Quantum Computing | Lex Fridman Podcast #72](https://youtu.be/uX5t8EivCaM)

* I also liked this video from Microsoft Research: [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://youtu.be/F_Riqjdh2oM)
  
* And Sean Carrolls explanation on Many-world interpretation: https://youtu.be/kxvQ3Wyw2M4

* Simplest problem that can be solved more efficient with QC is the Deutsch-Jozsa problem: [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm)

* Downloaded this book [Programming Quantum Computers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920167433.do)

* Got interested in this course: [The Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms?)

* This article covers Google's claim in quantum supremacy (and also has som good intro material): [Quantum Supremacy â€” Google Sycamore Processor](https://jonathan-hui.medium.com/quantum-supremacy-google-sycamore-processor-6f30073a17fa)
