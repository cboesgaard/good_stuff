# Quantum Computing

After watching som episodes of Devs I tried to find some good materials to learn about quantum computing.

* I liked this video from Microsoft Reearch: [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://youtu.be/F_Riqjdh2oM)

* Downloaded this book [Programming Quantum Computers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920167433.do)

* Got interested in this course: [The Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms?)
