# Quantum Computing

After watching som episodes of Devs I tried to find some good materials to learn about quantum computing.

* I liked this video from Microsoft Research: [Quantum Computing for Computer Scientists](https://youtu.be/F_Riqjdh2oM)

* Simplest problem that can be solved more efficient with QC is the Deutsch-Jozsa problem: [Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch%E2%80%93Jozsa_algorithm)

* Downloaded this book [Programming Quantum Computers](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920167433.do)

* Got interested in this course: [The Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-computing-algorithms?)
